# Smoke Detection With Fire Prevention Using Cisco Packet Tracer

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **Smoke Detection and Fire Prevention System** simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer. The system is designed to detect smoke levels in a networked environment and automatically trigger fire prevention measures. 

## Features

- **Smoke Detection**: The system utilizes sensors to monitor smoke levels in the environment.
- **Automatic Alerts**: Upon detecting dangerous levels of smoke, the system sends alerts to relevant devices or personnel.
- **Fire Prevention System Activation**: If smoke levels exceed a certain threshold, fire suppression systems (e.g., sprinklers, alarms) are automatically activated.
- **Network Communication**: All components communicate over a network simulated in Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Scalable System**: The setup is scalable and can be expanded to include additional sensors and devices as needed.

## Technologies Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: A simulation tool used for building the network of devices and simulating their interactions.
- **IoT Components**: The project utilizes IoT sensors (e.g., smoke sensors) and devices (e.g., fire suppression systems) available within Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Network Protocols**: Standard networking protocols are used to facilitate communication between devices.

## File Structure

- **Smoke Detection With Fire Prevention.pkt**: This file contains the Cisco Packet Tracer simulation for the project.

## Installation & Setup

To view and interact with the project:

1. Download and install Cisco Packet Tracer
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open the `Smoke Detection With Fire Prevention.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.

## How It Works

1. **Sensors**: Smoke sensors continuously monitor the environment.
2. **Threshold Breach**: If smoke levels reach a pre-defined threshold, an alert is generated.
3. **Alert Handling**: Alerts are communicated to central controllers or directly to fire suppression systems.
4. **Fire Suppression**: Upon alert, fire prevention systems such as sprinklers or alarms are automatically activated.
5. **Network Control**: The entire system is managed and controlled through a network setup in Cisco Packet Tracer, ensuring seamless communication between components.
